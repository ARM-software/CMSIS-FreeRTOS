\fn void EvrFreeRTOSSetup (uint32_t reset)
\details
The function \b EvrFreeRTOSSetup initializes Event Recorder and configures recording level filter. It must be called before any event is sent to the Event Recorder.

The argument \a reset specifies if reset of previously applied configuration is performed in case if EvrFreeRTOSSetup was already called.

Behavior of this function execution is defined with Event Recorder Configuration (\ref cmsis_freertos_evr_config). Calling this function has
no effect when Event Recorder component is not selected.

\note \b EvrFreeRTOSSetup is called by function \b osKernelInitialize when CMSIS-RTOS2 API is in use and should not be called explicitly.
