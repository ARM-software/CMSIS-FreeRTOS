The Blinky project is a simple CMSIS RTOS2 Kernel based example
for a simulated Cortex-A9 device.

The example simulates the step-motor driver. Four phase variables are
simulating the activation of the four output driver stages. The state
changes are output on the Watch window variable g_phases:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and CW rotation direction.


The Blinky example program is available for one target:
