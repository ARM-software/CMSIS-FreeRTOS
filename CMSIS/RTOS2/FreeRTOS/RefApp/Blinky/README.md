# CMSIS-RTOS2 Blinky Reference Application

The CMSIS-RTOS2 Blinky reference application is hardware agnostic application
that can be used with any development board that provides pre-configured
`stdout` and `CMSIS VIO` interface. It requires [software layer](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/build-overview/#software-layers)
with API drivers for the specific target hardware.

Use [Arm Keil Studio extensions for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack)
to [deploy this example](https://mdk-packs.github.io/vscode-cmsis-solution-docs/create_app.html#configure-a-solution)
to your development board.
