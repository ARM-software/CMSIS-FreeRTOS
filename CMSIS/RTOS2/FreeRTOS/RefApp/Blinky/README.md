# CMSIS-RTOS2 Blinky Reference Application

The CMSIS-RTOS2 Blinky reference application is hardware agnostic application
that can be used with any development board that provides pre-configured
`stdout` interface. It requires [software layer][1] with API drivers for the
specific target hardware.

Use [Arm Keil Studio extensions for VS Code][2] to [deploy this example][3]
to your development board.

See [CMSIS-Toolbox - Reference Applications][4] to learn more about the concept
of reference application in Open CMSIS Pack.
