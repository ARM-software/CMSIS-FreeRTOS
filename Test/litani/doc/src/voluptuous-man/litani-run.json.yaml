  # SYNOPSIS

  _run.json_: description of a single Litani run


  # DESCRIPTION

  Litani writes a _run.json_ file to its cache directory when the user
  invokes *litani-run-build(1)*. This file contains everything needed to
  generate the HTML dashboard, with the notable exception of any
  artefacts that the jobs might emit. (However, Litani does capture
  jobs' stdout and stderr; any output will be available in _run.json_.)
  This manual page describes _run.json_ 's format.


  *outcome_*, *status_*, and *single_job_schema_* are sub-schemata that
  are referenced multiple times within this schema, and so are defined
  separately below. All timestamps are in ISO-8601.
