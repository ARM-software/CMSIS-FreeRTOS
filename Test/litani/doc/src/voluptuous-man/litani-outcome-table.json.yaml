  # SYNOPSIS

  _outcome-table.json_: user-provided table to decide the outcome of a job


  # DESCRIPTION

  By default, Litani jobs' outcome is set to _success_ if their command
  returns 0, and _fail_ on other return codes or if the command timed
  out. This can be customized to some extent using the _--_..._-ok_ and
  _--_..._-ignore_ flags of *litani-add-job(1)*.  For more advanced use
  cases, users can pass a JSON file called an 'outcome table' to the
  _--outcome-table_ flag of *litani-add-job(1)*. This allows, for
  example, to cause an outcome other than success for a return code of
  0, for negative tests.

  This manual describes the schema for the JSON file that users should
  pass to *litani-add-job(1)*.
