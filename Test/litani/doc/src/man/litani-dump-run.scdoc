# NAME

litani dump-run - Print the current run as a JSON document to stdout


# SYNOPSIS

*litani dump-run*
	\[*--retries* _N_]


# DESCRIPTION

This program prints the _run.json_ file for an in-progress Litani run to stdout.
The JSON file's schema is documented in *litani-run.json(5)*.

This program is intended to be used while an invocation of *litani-run-build(1)*
is running. After the *run-build* process has terminated, this program will not
work (though this may change in future versions). Instead, you can access the
_run.json_ file in the run's output directory.

This program may be run as a Litani job, and it may be run as a subprocess from
a command that is part of a Litani job. This allows commands to 'introspect' on
a Litani run so far. It is guaranteed that if a single Litani job runs *litani
dump-run*, all of the reverse-dependencies of that job will have the
_"complete"_ key set to *True* in the printed _run.json_ file. That is, any job
that runs *litani dump-run* will always see the most up-to-date state of the
build with respect to its own reverse dependencies.


# MULTIPROCESS SAFETY

It is safe to run multiple invocations of *litani dump-run* in parallel.
However, if you do so, the printed result may be slightly out-of-date.

If you run *litani dump-run* from a Litani job, Litani will attempt to ensure
that the printed run is up-to-date with respect to that job. In particular,
Litani will try to re-load the run until all the reverse dependencies have their
_"complete"_ field set to *true*.


# OPTIONS

*-r* _N_, *--retries* _N_
	How many times to retry loading the run file if the *litani run-build* process
	doesn't emit it immediately. *litani dump-run* will retry loading the run once
	every second up to the limit given in this flag. If _N_ is *0*, this program
	will retry indefinitely---this is not recommended.


# OUTPUT

A JSON document printed to stdout. This will be either *null* (if this program was not able to load the run after a certain number of tries), or a document whose schema matches the one in *litani-run.json(5)*.


# RETURN CODE

Zero unless the program crashed.
