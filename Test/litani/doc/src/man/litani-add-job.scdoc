# DESCRIPTION

This program adds a job to an existing Litani run. The run must have been
previously created with *litani-init(1)*; you may add as many jobs as you need before
running them with *litani-run-build(1)*.

A _job_ is a command that is part of a dependency graph. Litani runs the command
if any of the job's inputs were out-of-date; once the inputs have been made
up-to-date, Litani runs the job, which thereby makes the job's outputs
up-to-date.

By repeatedly running *litani add-job*, you build up a dependency graph where
jobs are connected by their inputs and outputs. Running *litani run-build* makes
Litani run all of the jobs in the dependency graph that are needed to bring all
inputs and outputs up-to-date.

Many of the flags to this command give you platform-portable control on various
aspects of the program: timeouts, dealing with return codes, output streams, and
more.


# MULTIPROCESS SAFETY

It is safe to run multiple invocations of *litani add-job* in parallel.
Having a configure script that can run multiple invocations of *litani
add-job* from a thread pool (or similar) is recommended to decrease
configure times.


# OPTIONS

*--command* _CMD_
	The command that Litani will execute to emit the output files (if any) from
	the input files, once the input files are up-to-date. Litani invokes _CMD_
	through a subshell, so wildcards and shell expansions are supported and
	special characters must be escaped.

*--inputs* _F_ [_F_ ...]
	A list of inputs that this job depends on. Litani interprets each _F_ as a file:
	- If every _F_ exists and has an older timestamp than all of this job's
	  outputs, then Litani will not run this job.
	- If some of the _F_ are newer than any of this job's outputs, then those
	  outputs are called 'out-of-date'. In this case, Litani will run all of the
	  jobs whose outputs include every _F_ that is out of date before running this
	  job.
	- If option 2 applies, but there is no job whose output includes the
	  out-of-date files, then the build will fail.

*--outputs* _F_ [_F_ ...]
	A list of outputs that this job emits. Litani interprets each _F_ as a file,
	and expects that the command will write a file with that name upon completion.
	If a job _J_ has _F_ as an output, but does not actually write a file called
	_F_, then _J_ will run unconditionally because _F_ will always be considered
	out of date. Furthermore, all jobs whose inputs include _F_, and all their
	descendants, will also always run.

*--phony-outputs* [_OUT_ ...]
	Do not print a warning if this job has not written the named _OUT_ files by
	the time it finishes running. If you do not specify any _OUT_ files, Litani
	will not warn when _any_ output specified to the *--outputs* flag does not
	exist when the job has finished running.

	This is useful when you want to create a dependency ordering between two jobs,
	but the first job does not write any output files that the second job can
	depend on. To achieve this, you could pass *--outputs phony-file* when adding
	the first job, and *--inputs phony-file* when adding the second job. However,
	Litani will print a warning if the first job exits without writing a file
	called _phony-file_. To suppress the warning, instead pass *--phony-outputs
	phony-file* when adding the first job. Doing this obviates the need to use
	touchfiles for dependency ordering, which is how this must be done when using
	a traditional build system like *make(1)*.

*--description* _D_
	A human-readable description for this job. This flag is optional but highly
	recommended, as it makes the HTML dashboard much easier to navigate.

*--tags* _TAG_ [_TAG_ ...]
	A list of tags for this job. Litani does not interpret tags (although the HTML
	dashboard generator does use some of them). Each tag can be in whatever format
	you prefer, e.g. a plain string, key-value pair, or even arbitrary JSON. A
	job's list of tags is included in its _run.json_ and is intended to help with
	analyzing run data.

*--pipeline-name* _P_
	The 'pipeline' that this job is part of. A pipeline is a subgraph of the
	overall build, representing a single 'end-to-end' set of related jobs. A job's
	pipeline does not affect how it is scheduled to run, but is used for grouping
	related jobs in the HTML dashboard.

*--ci-stage* <_build_|_test_|_report_>
	The 'CI stage' that this job is part of. A CI stage is a subgraph of the
	overall build, representing a set of jobs that should complete before Litani
	moves onto the next stage. A job's CI stage does not affect how it is
	scheduled to run, but it is used for grouping related jobs in the HTML dashboard.

*--cwd* _DIR_
	The directory that this job should execute in.

*--ok-returns* _RC_ [_RC_ ...]
	Set the job outcome to _success_ if the command exits with a return code of
	_RC_. By default, a job is only considered successful if it returns with _0_.
	You can also use the *--outcome-table* option for fine-grained control over
	job outcomes.

*--ignore-returns* _RC_ [_RC_ ...]
	Set the job outcome to _fail_ignore_ if the command exits with a return code
	of _RC_. This means that jobs that depend on this one will still run as if
	this job had passed, but the pipeline that contains this job will fail after
	it completes.  This is useful when you want to generate a report even when a
	command fails; you specify the report as a dependency of the command, and use
	*--ignore-returns* to ensure that the report command runs even if the job
	fails. You can also use the *--outcome-table* option for fine-grained control
	over job outcomes.

*--timeout* _N_
	How many seconds this job should be allowed to run for. If the timeout is
	reached, then the command is killed with _SIGTERM_ followed by _SIGKILL_ (see
	*signal*(3)) and the _timeout_reached_ key of the job's record is set to _true_.
	By default, the job also fails if the timeout is reached, though this behavior
	can be modified using *--timeout-ok*, *--timeout-ignore*, and *--outcome-table*.

*--timeout-ok*
	Set the job outcome to _success_ if it reaches the timeout specified in the
	*--timeout* flag.

*--timeout-ignore*
	Set the job outcome to _fail_ignore_ if it reaches the timeout specified in the
	*--timeout* flag. This means that jobs that depend on this one will still run
	as if this job had passed, but the pipeline that contains this job will fail
	after it completes.

*--outcome-table* _F_
	Use the JSON-formatted outcome table _F_ to determine the outcome (_success_,
	_fail_, _fail-ignored_) of this job. Using outcome tables gives finer-grained
	control over outcomes than using the _--_..._-ok_ and _--_..._-ignore_ flags:
	in particular, it is possible to specify an action other than _success_ if the
	underlying *command* returns 0. This can be used, for example, to define
	negative tests. The schema for JSON outcome tables is specified in
	*litani-outcome-table.json(5)*.

*--interleave-stdout-stderr*
	Use a single pipe for the job's stdout and stderr. Similar to redirecting
	stderr to stdout using _2>&1 >..._. The job's _stdout_ list in the _run.json_
	file will contain lines of output from both stdout and stderr, while the value
	of _stderr_ will be _null_.

*--stdout-file* _F_
	Redirect the command's stdout to _F_. Litani will still retain a copy of the
	output in the _stdout_ field of the _run.json_ file. This flag is a useful
	alternative to using shell redirection (_>_).

*--stderr-file* _F_
	Redirect the command's stderr to _F_. Litani will still retain a copy of the
	output in the _stderr_ field of the _run.json_ file. This flag is a useful
	alternative to using shell redirection (_2>_).

*--pool* _P_
	Place this job in the pool named _P_. This pool must have been declared using
	the *--pools* flag of *litani init*. If pool _P_ has a depth of _D_, that
	means that a maximum of _D_ jobs whose pool is _P_ will be running in
	parallel (though there may be other jobs in other pools that are also running
	at the same time).

*--profile-memory*
	Turn on memory profiling for this job. The memory used by the command will be
	recorded in the _memory_trace_ field of _run.json_.

	The memory usage will also be included on a graph on the HTML dashboard if
	this job's tags include a "stats group". For each string _G_, all jobs that
	are tagged with "_stats-group:G_" and that have enabled memory profiling will
	be included on a graph comparing memory usage amongst those jobs. Different
	values for _G_ are intended to group different types of jobs. For example, you
	might tag all the compilation jobs with _stats-group:compilation_ and all the
	test jobs with _stats-group:test_. This will result in two graphs on the HTML
	dasahboard, each one depicting the memory usage of the compilation and test
	jobs respectively.

*--profile-memory-interval* _N_
	Profiles the memory usage of this job every _N_ seconds. Has no effect unless
	*--profile-memory* is also passed.


# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

*LITANI_JOB_ID*
	Litani passes the job's unique ID to the command through this environment variable.
	The unique id is the _job\_id_ field in the *litani-run.json(5)* representation.
