# NAME

litani run-build - Start a Litani run

# SYNOPSIS

litani run-build [OPTION...]

# DESCRIPTION

This program executes a Litani run. The run must have been created using
*litani init* and had jobs added to it using *litani add-job*.

# OPTIONS

*-n*, *--dry-run*
	Passes the *-n* flag directly to *ninja(1)*. This makes *ninja* parse
	and run the build graph in dry-run mode, acting as if all the commands
	succeeded.

*-j* _N_, *--parallel* _N_
	Run _N_ jobs in parallel. This passes the *-j* flag directly to
	*ninja(1)*. Ninja's default is calculated based on the number of cores
	in the system; run *ninja -h* to see the default. _N_=_0_ means do not
	restrict parallelism.

*-o* _F_, *--out-file* _F_
	Periodically write the _run.json_ file to _F_.

*--fail-on-pipeline-failure*
	Return _0_ only if all pipelines were successful. See *RETURN CODE*
	below.

*-p* _P_ _[P ...]_, *--pipelines* _P_ _[P ...]_
	Only run jobs that are part of the specified pipelines.

*-s* _S_, *--ci-stage* _S_
	Only run jobs that are part of the specified CI stage. Currently _S_
	must be one of _build_, _test_, or _report_.


# RETURN CODE

Unless there was a crash, this program should return _0_ upon exit
unless the *--fail-on-pipeline-failure* flag was supplied. In that case,
this program will return _0_ if all pipelines were successful and _1_
otherwise.
