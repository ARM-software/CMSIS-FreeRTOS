/*
 * This file initialises three timers as follows:
 *
 * TIM2 and TIM3 provide the interrupts that are used with the IntQ
 * standard demo tasks, which test interrupt nesting and using queues from
 * interrupts.  The timers generate interrupts at slightly different
 * frequencies and use different priorities, resulting in a nesting depth of
 * three (including the tick and PendSV interrupts, which run at lower
 * priorities).
 *
 * TIM4 provides a much higher frequency timer that tests the nesting
 * of interrupts that don't use the FreeRTOS API.  For convenience, the high
 * frequency timer also keeps a count of the number of times it executes, and
 * the count can be used as the time base for the run time stats.
 *
 * All the timers can nest with the tick interrupt - creating a maximum
 * interrupt nesting depth of 4.
 *
