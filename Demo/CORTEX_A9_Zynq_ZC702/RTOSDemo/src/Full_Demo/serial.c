	BASIC INTERRUPT DRIVEN SERIAL PORT DRIVER.

	Note1:  This driver is used specifically to provide an interface to the
	FreeRTOS+CLI command interpreter.  It is *not* intended to be a generic
	serial port driver.  Nor is it intended to be used as an example of an
	efficient implementation.  In particular, a queue is used to buffer
	received characters, which is fine in this case as key presses arrive
	slowly, but a DMA and/or RAM buffer should be used in place of the queue in
	applications that expect higher throughput.

	Note2:  This driver does not attempt to handle UART errors.
