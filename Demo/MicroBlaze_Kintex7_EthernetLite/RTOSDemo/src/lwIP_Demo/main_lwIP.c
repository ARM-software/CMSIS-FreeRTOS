/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides three demo applications.  A simple blinky
 * style project, a more comprehensive test and demo application, and an
 * lwIP example.  The mainSELECTED_APPLICATION setting in main.c is used to
 * select between the three.  See the notes on using mainSELECTED_APPLICATION
 * in main.c.  This file implements the simply blinky style version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * basic demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * The lwIP example can be configured to use either a static or dynamic IP
 * address:
 *    + To use a dynamically allocated IP address set LWIP_DHCP to 1 in
 *      lwipopts.h and connect the target to a network that includes a DHCP
 *      server.  The obtained IP address is printed to the UART console.
 *    + To use a static IP address set LWIP_DHCP to 0 in lwipopts.h and set
 *      the static IP address using the configIP_ADDR0 to configIP_ADDR3
 *      constants at the bottom of FreeRTOSConfig.h.  Constants used to define
 *      a netmask are also located at the bottom of FreeRTOSConfig.h.
 *
 * When connected correctly the demo uses the lwIP sockets API to create
 * a FreeRTOS+CLI command console, and the lwIP raw API to create a basic HTTP
 * web server with server side includes that generate dynamic run time web
 * pages.  See http://www.freertos.org/RTOS-Xilinx-Zynq.html for more
 * information.
 *
 * To connect to FreeRTOS+CLI, open a command prompt and enter "telnet <ipaddr>"
 * where <ipaddr> is the IP address of the target.  Once connected type "help"
 * to see a list of registered commands.  Note this example does not implement
 * a real telnet server, it just uses the telnet port number to allow easy
 * connection using telnet tools.
 *
 * To connect to the http server simply type the IP address of the target into
 * the address bar of a web browser.
