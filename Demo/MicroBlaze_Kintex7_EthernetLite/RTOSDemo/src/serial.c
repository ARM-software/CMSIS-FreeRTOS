	BASIC INTERRUPT DRIVEN SERIAL PORT DRIVER FOR a UARTLite peripheral.

	NOTE:  This is not intended to represent an efficient driver.  It is
	designed to test the FreeRTOS port.  Normally a UART driver would use a DMA,
	or at least a circular RAM buffer rather than a queue.  A task notification
	can then be used to unblock any task that is waiting for a complete message
	once a complete message has been buffered.
