/*
 * Interrupt service routines that cannot nest have no special requirements and
 * can be written as per the compiler documentation. However interrupts written
 * in this manner will utilise the stack of whichever task was interrupts,
 * rather than the system stack, necessitating that adequate stack space be
 * allocated to each created task. It is therefore not recommended to write
 * interrupt service routines in this manner.
 *
 * Interrupts service routines that can nest require a simple assembly wrapper.
 * This file is provided as a example of how this is done.
 *
 * The example in this file creates a single task.  The task blocks on a
 * semaphore which is periodically 'given' from a timer interrupt.  The assembly
 * wrapper for the interrupt is implemented in ISRTriggeredTask_isr.S.  The
 * C function called by the assembly wrapper is implemented in this file.
 *
 * The task toggle LED mainISR_TRIGGERED_LED each time it is unblocked by the
 * interrupt.
