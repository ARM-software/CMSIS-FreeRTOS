/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks.
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "LCD" task - the LCD task is a 'gatekeeper' task.  It is the only task that
 * is permitted to access the display directly.  Other tasks wishing to write a
 * message to the LCD send the message on a queue to the LCD task instead of
 * accessing the LCD themselves.  The LCD task just blocks on the queue waiting
 * for messages - waking and displaying the messages as they arrive.
 *
 * "Check" hook -  This only executes every five seconds from the tick hook.
 * Its main function is to check that all the standard demo tasks are still
 * operational.  Should any unexpected behaviour within a demo task be discovered
 * the tick hook will write an error to the LCD (via the LCD task).  If all the
 * demo tasks are executing with their expected behaviour then the check task
 * writes PASS to the LCD (again via the LCD task), as described above.
 *
 * "uIP" task -  This is the task that handles the uIP stack.  All TCP/IP
 * processing is performed in this task.
