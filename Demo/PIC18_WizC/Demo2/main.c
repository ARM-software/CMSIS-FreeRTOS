/*
 * Instead of the normal single demo application, the PIC18F demo is split
 * into several smaller programs of which this is the second.  This enables the
 * demo's to be executed on the RAM limited PIC-devices.
 *
 * The Demo2 project is configured for a PIC18F4620 device.  Main.c starts 12
 * tasks (including the idle task). See the indicated files in the demo/common
 * directory for more information.
 *
 * demo/common/minimal/integer.c:	Creates 1 task
 * demo/common/minimal/PollQ.c:		Creates 2 tasks
 * demo/common/minimal/semtest.c:	Creates 4 tasks
 * demo/common/minimal/flash.c:		Creates 3 tasks
 *
 * Main.c also creates a check task.  This periodically checks that all the
 * other tasks are still running and have not experienced any unexpected
 * results.  If all the other tasks are executing correctly an LED is flashed
 * once every mainCHECK_PERIOD milliseconds.  If any of the tasks have not
 * executed, or report an error, the frequency of the LED flash will increase
 * to mainERROR_FLASH_RATE.
 *
 * On entry to main an 'X' is transmitted.  Monitoring the serial port using a
 * dumb terminal allows for verification that the device is not continuously
 * being reset (no more than one 'X' should be transmitted).
 *
 * http://www.FreeRTOS.org contains important information on the use of the
 * wizC PIC18F port.
