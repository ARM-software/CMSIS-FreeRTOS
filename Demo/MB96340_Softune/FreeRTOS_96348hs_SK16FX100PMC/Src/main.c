 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the follow demo specific tasks are
 * create:
 *
 * The "Check" task.  This only executes every three seconds but has the highest
 * priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.  Its main function is to
 * check that all the other tasks are still operational.  Most tasks maintain
 * a unique count that is incremented each time the task successfully completes
 * its function.  Should any error occur within such a task the count is
 * permanently halted.  The check task inspects the count of each task to ensure
 * it has changed since the last time the check task executed.  If all the count
 * variables have changed all the tasks are still executing error free, and the
 * check task toggles the onboard LED.  Should any task contain an error at any time
 * the LED toggle rate will change from 3 seconds to 500ms.
 *
 * The "Trace Utility" task.  This can be used to obtain trace and debug
 * information via UART1.
