	BASIC INTERRUPT DRIVEN SERIAL PORT DRIVER FOR USART1.

	***Note*** This example uses queues to send each character into an interrupt
	service routine and out of an interrupt service routine individually.  This
	is done to demonstrate queues being used in an interrupt, and to deliberately
	load the system to test the FreeRTOS port.  It is *NOT* meant to be an
	example of an efficient implementation.  An efficient implementation should
	use FIFO's or DMA if available, and only use FreeRTOS API functions when
	enough has been received to warrant a task being unblocked to process the
	data.
