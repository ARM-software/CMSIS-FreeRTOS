/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the demo application tasks.
 *
 * This demo is configured to execute on the ES449 prototyping board from
 * SoftBaugh. The ES449 has a built in LCD display and a single built in user
 * LED.  Therefore, in place of flashing an LED, the 'flash' and 'check' tasks
 * toggle '*' characters on the LCD.  The left most '*' represents LED 0, the
 * next LED 1, etc.
 *
 * Main. c also creates a task called 'Check'.  This only executes every three
 * seconds but has the highest priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.
 * Its main function is to check that all the other tasks are still operational.
 * Each task that does not flash an LED maintains a unique count that is
 * incremented each time the task successfully completes its function.  Should
 * any error occur within such a task the count is permanently halted.  The
 * 'check' task inspects the count of each task to ensure it has changed since
 * the last time the check task executed.  If all the count variables have
 * changed all the tasks are still executing error free, and the check task
 * toggles an LED with a three second period.  Should any task contain an error
 * at any time the LED toggle rate will increase to 500ms.
 *
 * Please read the documentation for the MSP430 port available on
 * http://www.FreeRTOS.org.
