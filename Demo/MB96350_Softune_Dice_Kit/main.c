 *
 * See http://www.freertos.org/Documentation/FreeRTOS-documentation-and-book.html
 * for an introductory guide to using real time kernels, and FreeRTOS in
 * particular.
 *
 *****
 *
 * The DICE-KIT-16FX has two 7 segment displays and two buttons that can
 * generate interrupts.  This example uses this IO as follows:
 *
 *
 * - Left 7 segment display -
 *
 * 7 'flash' tasks are created, each of which toggles a single segment of the
 * left display.  Each task executes at a fixed frequency, with a different
 * frequency being used by each task.
 *
 * When button SW2 is pressed an interrupt is generated that wakes up a 'dice'
 * task.  The dice task suspends the 7 tasks that are accessing the left display
 * before simulating a dice being thrown by generating a random number between
 * 1 and 6.  After the number has been generated the task sleeps for 5 seconds,
 * if SW2 is pressed again within the 5 seconds another random number is
 * generated, if SW2 is not pressed within the 5 seconds then the 7 tasks are
 * un-suspended and will once again toggle the segments of the left hand display.
 *
 *
 * - Right 7 segment display -
 *
 * Control of the right side 7 segment display is very similar to that of the
 * left, except co-routines are used to toggle the segments instead of tasks,
 * and button SW3 is used instead of SW2.
 *
 *
 * - Notes -
 *
 * Only one dice task is actually defined.  Two instances of this single
 * definition are created, the first to simulate a dice being thrown on the left
 * display, and the other to simulate a dice being thrown on the right display.
 * The task parameter is used to let the dice tasks know which display to
 * control.
 *
 * Both dice tasks and the flash tasks operate completely independently under
 * the control of FreeRTOS.  11 tasks and 7 co-routines are created in total,
 * including the idle task.
 *
 * The co-routines all execute within a single low priority task.
 *
 *
 *
 * When this demo is executing as expected:
 *
 * + Every segment of both displays will toggle at a fixed frequency - with each
 *   segment using a different frequency.
 * + When a button is pushed the segment toggling will temporarily stop and the
 *   dice 'throw' will start whereby the display will show a fast changing random
 *   number for a few seconds before the dice value is chosen and displayed.
 * + If the button is not pushed again within five seconds of the dice value being
 *   displayed the segment toggling will commence again.
