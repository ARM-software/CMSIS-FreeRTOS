  @mainpage SmartFusion MSS I2C Bare Metal Driver.

  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The SmartFusion™ microcontroller subsystem (MSS) includes two I2C peripherals
  for serial communication. This driver provides a set of functions for
  controlling the MSS I2Cs as part of a bare metal system where no operating
  system is available. These drivers can be adapted for use as part of an
  operating system, but the implementation of the adaptation layer between this
  driver and the operating system's driver model is outside the scope of this
  driver.

  @section hw_dependencies Hardware Flow Dependencies
  The configuration of all features of the MSS I2Cs is covered by this driver
  with the exception of the SmartFusion IOMUX configuration. SmartFusion allows
  multiple non-concurrent uses of some external pins through IOMUX configuration.
  This feature allows optimization of external pin usage by assigning external
  pins for use by either the microcontroller subsystem or the FPGA fabric. The
  MSS I2Cs serial signals are routed through IOMUXes to the SmartFusion device
  external pins. These IOMUXes are automatically configured correctly by the MSS
  configurator tool in the hardware flow when the MSS I2Cs are enabled in that
  tool. You must ensure that the MSS I2Cs are enabled by the MSS configurator
  tool in the hardware flow; otherwise the serial inputs and outputs will not be
  connected to the chip's external pins. For more information on IOMUX, refer to
  the IOMUX section of the SmartFusion Datasheet.
  The base address, register addresses and interrupt number assignment for the
  MSS I2C blocks are defined as constants in the SmartFusion CMSIS-PAL. You must
  ensure that the SmartFusion CMSIS-PAL is either included in the software tool
  chain used to build your project or is included in your project.

  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The MSS I2C driver functions are grouped into the following categories:
    • Initialization and configuration functions
    • Interrupt control
    • I2C master operations – functions to handle write, read and write-read transactions
    • I2C slave operations – functions to handle write, read and write-read transactions

  Initialization and Configuration
    The MSS I2C driver is initialized through a call to the MSS_I2C_init()
    function. This function takes the MSS I2C's configuration as parameters. The
    MSS_I2C_init() function must be called before any other MSS I2C driver
    functions can be called. The first parameter of the MSS_I2C_init() function
    is a pointer to one of two global data structures used by the driver to
    store state information for each MSS I2C. A pointer to these data structures
    is also used as first parameter to any of the driver functions to identify
    which MSS I2C will be used by the called function. The names of these two
    data structures are g_mss_i2c0 and g_mss_i2c1. Therefore any call to an MSS
    I2C driver function should be of the form MSS_I2C_function_name( &g_mss_i2c0, ... )
    or MSS_I2C_function_name( &g_mss_i2c1, ... ).
    The MSS_I2C_init() function call for each MSS I2C also takes the I2C serial
    address assigned to the MSS I2C and the serial clock divider to be used to
    generate its I2C clock as configuration parameters.

  Interrupt Control
    The MSS I2C driver is interrupt driven and it enables and disables the
    generation of interrupts by MSS I2C at various times when it is operating.
    The driver automatically handles MSS I2C interrupts internally, including
    enabling disabling and clearing MSS I2C interrupts in the Cortex-M3
    interrupt controller when required.
    The function MSS_I2C_register_write_handler() is used to register a write
    handler function with the MSS I2C driver that it will call on completion of
    an I2C write transaction by the MSS I2C slave. It is your responsibility to
    create and register the implementation of this handler function that will
    process or trigger the processing of the received data.
  Transaction Types
    The MSS I2C driver is designed to handle three types of I2C transaction:
      • Write transactions
      • Read transactions
      • Write-read transactions

    Write transaction
      The master I2C device initiates a write transaction by sending a START bit
      as soon as the bus becomes free. The START bit is followed by the 7-bit
      serial address of the target slave device followed by the read/write bit
      indicating the direction of the transaction. The slave acknowledges receipt
      of it’s address with an acknowledge bit. The master sends data one byte at
      a time to the slave, which must acknowledge receipt of each byte for the
      next byte to be sent. The master sends a STOP bit to complete the transaction.
      The slave can abort the transaction by replying with a non-acknowledge bit
      instead of an acknowledge.
      The application programmer can choose not to send a STOP bit at the end of
      the transaction causing the next transaction to begin with a repeated START bit.

    Read transaction
      The master I2C device initiates a read transaction by sending a START bit
      as soon as the bus becomes free. The START bit is followed by the 7-bit
      serial address of the target slave device followed by the read/write bit
      indicating the direction of the transaction. The slave acknowledges receipt
      of it’s slave address with an acknowledge bit. The slave sends data one byte
      at a time to the master, which must acknowledge receipt of each byte for the
      next byte to be sent. The master sends a non-acknowledge bit following the
      last byte it wishes to read followed by a STOP bit.
      The application programmer can choose not to send a STOP bit at the end of
      the transaction causing the next transaction to begin with a repeated START bit.

    Write-read transaction
      The write-read transaction is a combination of a write transaction
      immediately followed by a read transaction. There is no STOP bit between
      the write and read phases of a write-read transaction. A repeated START
      bit is sent between the write and read phases.
      The write-read transaction is typically used to send a command or offset
      in the write transaction specifying the logical data to be transferred
      during the read phase.
      The application programmer can choose not to send a STOP bit at the end of
      the transaction causing the next transaction to begin with a repeated START bit.

  Master Operations
    The application can use the MSS_I2C_write(), MSS_I2C_read() and MSS_I2C_write_read()
    functions to initiate an I2C bus transaction. The application can then wait
    for the transaction to complete using the MSS_I2C_wait_complete() function
    or poll the status of the I2C transaction using the MSS_I2C_get_status()
    function until it returns a value different from MSS_I2C_IN_PROGRESS.

  Slave Operations
    The configuration of the MSS I2C driver to operate as an I2C slave requires
    the use of the following functions:
      • MSS_I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer()
      • MSS_I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer()
      • MSS_I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length()
      • MSS_I2C_register_write_handler()
      • MSS_I2C_enable_slave_rx()
    Use of all functions is not required if the slave I2C does not need to support
    all types of I2C read transactions. The subsequent sections list the functions
    that must be used to support each transaction type.

    Responding to read transactions
      The following functions are used to configure the MSS I2C driver to respond
      to I2C read transactions:
        • MSS_I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer()
        • MSS_I2C_enable_slave_rx()
      The function MSS_I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer() specifies the data buffer that
      will be transmitted when the I2C slave is the target of an I2C read
      transaction. It is then up to the application to manage the content of that
      buffer to control the data that will be transmitted to the I2C master as a
      result of the read transaction.
      The function MSS_I2C_enable_slave_rx() enables the MSS I2C hardware instance
      to respond to I2C transactions. It must be called after the MSS I2C driver
      has been configured to respond to the required transaction types.

    Responding to write transactions
      The following functions are used to configure the MSS I2C driver to respond
      to I2C write transactions:
        • MSS_I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer()
        • MSS_I2C_register_write_handler()
        • MSS_I2C_enable_slave_rx()
      The function MSS_I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer() specifies the data buffer that
      will be used to store the data received by the I2C slave when it is the
      target an I2C  write transaction.
      The function MSS_I2C_register_write_handler() specifies the handler function
      that must be called on completion of the I2C write transaction. It is this
      handler function that will process or trigger the processing of the received
      data.
      The function MSS_I2C_enable_slave_rx() enables the MSS I2C hardware instance
      to respond to I2C transactions. It must be called after the MSS I2C driver
      has been configured to respond to the required transaction types.

    Responding to write-read transactions
      The following functions are used to configure the MSS I2C driver to respond
      to write-read transactions:
        • MSS_I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer()
        • MSS_I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer()
        • MSS_I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length()
        • MSS_I2C_enable_slave_rx()
      The function MSS_I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length() specifies the number of
      bytes expected by the I2C slave during the write phase of the write-read
      transaction.
      The function MSS_I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer() specifies the data that will be
      transmitted to the I2C master during the read phase of the write-read
      transaction. The value received by the I2C slave during the write phase of
      the transaction will be used as an index into the transmit buffer specified
      by this function to decide which part of the transmit buffer will be
      transmitted to the I2C master as part of the read phase of the write-read
      transaction.
      The function MSS_I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer() specifies the data buffer that
      will be used to store the data received by the I2C slave during the write
      phase of the write-read transaction. This buffer must be at least large
      enough to accommodate the number of bytes specified through the
      MSS_I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length() function.
      The function MSS_I2C_enable_slave_rx() enables the MSS I2C hardware
      instance to respond to I2C transactions. It must be called after the MSS
      I2C driver has been configured to respond to the required transaction types.

  Slave write handler functions prototype.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This defines the function prototype that must be followed by MSS I2C slave
  write handler functions. These functions are registered with the MSS I2C driver
  through the MSS_I2C_register_write_handler() function.

  Declaring and Implementing Slave Write Handler Functions:
    Slave write handler functions should follow the following prototype:
    mss_i2c_slave_handler_ret_t write_handler( uint8_t * data, uint16_t size );

    The data parameter is a pointer to a buffer (received data buffer) holding
    the data written to the MSS I2C slave.
    The size parameter is the number of bytes held in the received data buffer.
    Handler functions must return one of the following values:
        • MSS_I2C_REENABLE_SLAVE_RX
        • MSS_I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX.
    If the handler function returns MSS_I2C_REENABLE_SLAVE_RX, the driver will
    release the received data buffer and allow further I2C write transactions to
    the MSS I2C slave to take place.
    If the handler function returns MSS_I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX, the MSS I2C slave
    will respond to subsequent write requests with a non-acknowledge bit (NACK),
    until the received data buffer content has been processed by some other part
    of the software application.
    A call to MSS_I2C_enable_slave_rx() is required at some point after
    returning MSS_I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX in order to release the received data
    buffer so it can be used to store data received by subsequent I2C write
    transactions.

  @param read_buffer:
  	This parameter is a pointer to the buffer where the data read from the I2C
    slave will be stored.

  @param read_size:
  	This parameter specifies the number of bytes to read from the target I2C
    slave device. This size must not exceed the size of the buffer pointed to by
    the read_buffer parameter.

  @param options:
 	The options parameter is used to indicate if the I2C bus should be released
    on completion of the write-read transaction. Using the MSS_I2C_RELEASE_BUS
    constant for the options parameter causes a STOP bit to be generated at the
    end of the write-read transaction causing the bus to be released for other
    I2C devices to use. Using the MSS_I2C_HOLD_BUS constant as options parameter
    prevents a STOP bit from being generated at the end of the write-read
    transaction, preventing other I2C devices from initiating a bus transaction.
