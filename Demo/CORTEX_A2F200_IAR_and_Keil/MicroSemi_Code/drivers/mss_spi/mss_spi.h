  @mainpage SmartFusion MSS SPI Bare Metal Driver.

  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The SmartFusion™ microcontroller subsystem (MSS) includes two serial
  peripheral interface SPI peripherals for serial communication. This driver
  provides a set of functions for controlling the MSS SPIs as part of a bare
  metal system where no operating system is available. These drivers can be
  adapted for use as part of an operating system, but the implementation of the
  adaptation layer between this driver and the operating system's driver model
  is outside the scope of this driver.
  
  @section hw_dependencies Hardware Flow Dependencies
  The configuration of all features of the MSS SPIs is covered by this driver
  with the exception of the SmartFusion IOMUX configuration. SmartFusion allows
  multiple non-concurrent uses of some external pins through IOMUX configuration.
  This feature allows optimization of external pin usage by assigning external
  pins for use by either the microcontroller subsystem or the FPGA fabric. The
  MSS SPIs serial signals are routed through IOMUXes to the SmartFusion device
  external pins. These IOMUXes are automatically configured correctly by the MSS
  configurator tool in the hardware flow when the MSS SPIs are enabled in that
  tool. You must ensure that the MSS SPIs are enabled by the MSS configurator
  tool in the hardware flow; otherwise the serial inputs and outputs will not be
  connected to the chip's external pins. For more information on IOMUX, refer to
  the IOMUX section of the SmartFusion Datasheet.
  The base address, register addresses and interrupt number assignment for the
  MSS SPI blocks are defined as constants in the SmartFusion CMSIS-PAL. You must
  ensure that the SmartFusion CMSIS-PAL is either included in the software tool
  chain used to build your project or is included in your project.
  
  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The MSS SPI driver functions are grouped into the following categories:
    • Initialization
    • Configuration for either master or slave operations
    • SPI master frame transfer control
    • SPI master block transfer control
    • SPI slave frame transfer control
    • SPI slave block transfer control
    • DMA block transfer
  Frame transfers allow the MSS SPI to write or read up to 32 bits of data in a
  SPI transaction. For example, a frame transfer of 12 bits might be used to
  read the result of an ADC conversion from a SPI analog to digital converter.
  Block transfers allow the MSS SPI to write or read a number of bytes in a SPI
  transaction. Block transfer transactions allow data transfers in multiples of
  8 bits (8, 16, 24, 32, 40…). Block transfers are typically used with byte
  oriented devices like SPI FLASH devices.

  Initialization 
    The MSS SPI driver is initialized through a call to the MSS_SPI_init()
    function. The MSS_SPI_init() function takes only one parameter, a pointer
    to one of two global data structures used by the driver to store state
    information for each MSS SPI. A pointer to these data structures is also
    used as first parameter to any of the driver functions to identify which MSS
    SPI will be used by the called function. The names of these two data
    structures are g_mss_spi0 and g_mss_spi1. Therefore any call to an MSS SPI
    driver function should be of the form MSS_SPI_function_name( &g_mss_spi0, ... )
    or MSS_SPI_function_name( &g_mss_spi1, ... ).
    The MSS_SPI_init() function resets the specified MSS SPI hardware block and
    clears any pending interrupts from that MSS SPI in the Cortex-M3 NVIC.
    The MSS_SPI_init() function must be called before any other MSS SPI driver
    functions can be called.

  Configuration
    A MSS SPI block can operate either as a master or slave SPI device. There
    are two distinct functions for configuring a MSS SPI block for master or
    slave operations.

    Master configuration
    The MSS_SPI_configure_master_mode() function configures the specified MSS
    SPI block for operations as a SPI master. It must be called once for each
    remote SPI slave device the MSS SPI block will communicate with. It is used
    to provide the following information about each SPI slave’s communication
    characteristics:
        • The SPI protocol mode
        • The SPI clock speed
        • The frame bit length
    This information is held by the driver and will be used to alter the
    configuration of the MSS SPI block each time a slave is selected through a
    call to MSS_SPI_set_slave_select(). The SPI protocol mode defines the
    initial state of the clock signal at the start of a transaction and which
    clock edge will be used to sample the data signal, or it defines whether the
    SPI block will operate in TI synchronous serial mode or in NSC MICROWIRE mode.

    Slave configuration
    The MSS_SPI_configure_slave_mode() function configures the specified MSS SPI
    block for operations as a SPI slave. It configures the following SPI
    communication characteristics:
        • The SPI protocol mode 
        • The SPI clock speed
        • The frame bit length
    The SPI protocol mode defines the initial state of the clock signal at the
    start of a transaction and which clock edge will be used to sample the data
    signal, or it defines whether the SPI block will operate in TI synchronous
    serial mode or in NSC MICROWIRE mode.

  SPI master frame transfer control
    The following functions are used as part of SPI master frame transfers:
        • MSS_SPI_set_slave_select()
        • MSS_SPI_transfer_frame()
        • MSS_SPI_clear_slave_select()
    The master must first select the target slave through a call to
    MSS_SPI_set_slave_select(). This causes the relevant slave select line to
    become asserted while data is clocked out onto the SPI data line.
    A call to is then made to function MSS_SPI_transfer_frame() specifying and
    the value of the data frame to be sent.
    The function MSS_SPI_clear_slave_select() can be used after the transfer is
    complete to prevent this slave select line from being asserted during
    subsequent SPI transactions. A call to this function is only required if the
    master is communicating with multiple slave devices.

  SPI master block transfer control
    The following functions are used as part of SPI master block transfers:
        • MSS_SPI_set_slave_select()
        • MSS_SPI_clear_slave_select()
        • MSS_SPI_transfer_block()
    The master must first select the target slave through a call to
    MSS_SPI_set_slave_select(). This causes the relevant slave select line to
    become asserted while data is clocked out onto the SPI data line.
    Alternatively a GPIO can be used to control the state of the target slave
    device’s chip select signal.
    A call to is then made to function MSS_SPI_transfer_block (). The
    parameters of this function specify:
        • the number of bytes to be transmitted
        • a pointer to the buffer containing the data to be transmitted
        • the number of bytes to be received
        • a pointer to the buffer where received data will be stored
    The number of bytes to be transmitted can be set to zero to indicate that
    the transfer is purely a block read transfer. The number of bytes to be
    received can be set to zero to specify that the transfer is purely a block
    write transfer.
    The function MSS_SPI_clear_slave_select() can be used after the transfer is
    complete to prevent this slave select line from being asserted during
    subsequent SPI transactions. A call to this function is only required if the
    master is communicating with multiple slave devices.
 
  SPI slave frame transfer control
    The following functions are used as part of SPI slave frame transfers:
        • MSS_SPI_set_slave_tx_frame()
        • MSS_SPI_set_frame_rx_handler()
    The MSS_SPI_set_slave_tx_frame() function specifies the frame data that will
    be returned to the SPI master. The frame data specified through this
    function is the value that will be read over the SPI bus by the remote SPI
    master when it initiates a transaction. A call to MSS_SPI_set_slave_tx_frame()
    is only required if the MSS SPI slave is the target of SPI  read transactions,
    i.e. if data is meant to be read from the SmartFusion device over SPI.
    The MSS_SPI_set_frame_rx_handler() function specifies the receive handler
    function that will called when a frame of data has been received by the MSS
    SPI when it is configured as a slave. The receive handler function specified
    through this call will process the frame data written, over the SPI bus, to
    the MSS SPI slave by the remote SPI master. The receive handler function must
    be implemented as part of the application. It is only required if the MSS SPI
    slave is the target of SPI frame write transactions.

  SPI slave block transfer control
    The following functions are used as part of SPI slave block transfers:
        • MSS_SPI_set_slave_block_buffers()
    The MSS_SPI_set_slave_block_buffers() function is used to configure a MSS SPI
    slave for block transfer operations. It specifies:
        • The buffer containing the data that will be returned to the remote SPI master
        • The buffer where data received from the remote SPI master will be stored
        • The handler function that will be called after the receive buffer is filled

  DMA block transfer control
    The following functions are used as part of MSS SPI DMA transfers:
        • MSS_SPI_disable()
        • MSS_SPI_set_transfer_byte_count()
        • MSS_SPI_enable()
        • MSS_SPI_tx_done()
    The MSS SPI must first be disabled through a call to function MSS_SPI_disable().
    The number of bytes to be transferred is then set through a call to function
    MSS_SPI_set_transfer_byte_count(). The DMA transfer is then initiated by a call
    to the MSS_PDMA_start() function provided by the MSS PDMA driver. The actual
    DMA transfer will only start once the MSS SPI block has been re-enabled through
    a call to  MSS_SPI_enable(). The completion of the DMA driven SPI transfer can
    be detected through a call to MSS_SPI_tx_done(). The direction of the SPI
    transfer, write or read, depends on the DMA channel configuration. A SPI write
    transfer occurs when the DMA channel is configured to write data to the MSS SPI
    block. A SPI read transfer occurs when the DMA channel is configured to read data
    from the MSS SPI block.

  The MSS_SPI_transfer_block() function is used by MSS SPI masters to transmit

    • Writing a data block to a slave
    • Reading a data block from a slave
    • Sending a command to a slave followed by reading the outcome of the
      command in a single SPI transaction. This function can be used alongside

      hardware block using Peripheral DMA.
 
  @param this_spi
    The this_spi parameter is a pointer to an mss_spi_instance_t structure
    identifying the MSS SPI hardware block to be initialized. There are two such
    data structures, g_mss_spi0 and g_mss_spi1, associated with MSS SPI 0 and
    MSS SPI 1 respectively. This parameter must point to either the g_mss_spi0
    or g_mss_spi1 global data structure defined within the SPI driver.
    
 
  @param cmd_buffer
    The cmd_buffer parameter is a pointer to the buffer containing the data that
    will be sent by the master from the beginning of the transfer. This pointer
    can be null (0) if the master does not need to send a command before reading
    data or if the command part of the transfer is written to the SPI hardware
    block using DMA.
 
  @param cmd_byte_size
    The cmd_byte_size parameter specifies the number of bytes contained in
    cmd_buffer that will be sent. A value of 0 indicates that no data needs to
    be sent to the slave. A non-zero value while the cmd_buffer pointer is 0 is
    used to indicate that the command data will be written to the SPI hardware
    block using DMA.
 
  @param rd_buffer
    The rd_buffer parameter is a pointer to the buffer where the data received
    from the slave after the command has been sent will be stored.
 
  @param rd_byte_size
    The rd_byte_size parameter specifies the number of bytes to be received from
    the slave and stored in the rd_buffer. A value of 0 indicates that no data
    is to be read from the slave. A non-zero value while the rd_buffer pointer
    is null (0) is used to specify the receive size when using DMA to read from
    the slave. 
    Note:   All bytes received from the slave, including the bytes received
            while the command is sent, will be read through DMA.

  DMA transfer example:
  In this example the transmit and receive buffers are not specified as part of
  the call to MSS_SPI_transfer_block(). MSS_SPI_transfer_block() will only
  prepare the MSS SPI hardware for a transfer. The MSS SPI transmit hardware
  FIFO is filled using one DMA channel and a second DMA channel is used to read
  the content of the MSS SPI receive hardware FIFO. The transmit and receive
  buffers are specified by two separate calls to PDMA_start() to initiate DMA
  transfers on the channel used for transmit data and the channel used for
  receive data.

    • Slave performing an action after receiving a block of data from a master
      containing a command. The action will be performed by the receive handling
      based on the content of the receive data buffer.
    • Slave returning a block of data to the master. The type of information is
      always the same but the actual values change over time. For example,
      returning the voltage of a predefined set of analog inputs.
    • Slave returning data based on a command contained in the first part of the
      SPI transaction. For example, reading the voltage of the analog input
      specified by the first data byte by the master. This is achieved by setting
      the rx_buff_size parameter to the number of received bytes making up the
      command.
  
  @param this_spi
    The this_spi parameter is a pointer to an mss_spi_instance_t structure
    identifying the MSS SPI hardware block to be initialized. There are two such
    data structures, g_mss_spi0 and g_mss_spi1, associated with MSS SPI 0 and
    MSS SPI 1 respectively. This parameter must point to either the g_mss_spi0
    or g_mss_spi1 global data structure defined within the SPI driver.
    
 
  @param tx_buffer
    The tx_buffer parameter is a pointer to a buffer containing the data that
    will be sent to the master. This parameter can be set to 0 if the MSS SPI
    slave is not intended to be the target of SPI read transactions or if DMA
    is used to transfer SPI read data into the MSS SPI slave.
 
  @param tx_buff_size
    The tx_buff_size parameter specifies the number of bytes contained in the
    tx_buffer. This parameter can be set to 0 if the MSS SPI slave is not
    intended to be the target of SPI read transactions or if DMA is used to
    transfer SPI read data into the MSS SPI slave.
 
  @param rx_buffer
    The rx_buffer parameter is a pointer to the buffer where data received from
    the master will be stored. This parameter can be set to 0 if the MSS SPI
    slave is not intended to be the target of SPI write or write-read
    transactions. It can also set to 0 if the MSS SPI slave uses DMA to handle
    data written to it.
 
  @param rx_buff_size
    The rx_buff_size parameter specifies the size of the receive buffer. It is
    also the number of bytes that must be received before the receive handler
    is called, if a receive handler is specified using the block_rx_handler
    parameter. This parameter can be set to 0 if the MSS SPI slave is not
    intended to be the target of SPI write or write-read transactions. It can
    also set to 0 if the MSS SPI slave uses DMA to handle data written to it.
 
  @param block_rx_handler
    The block_rx_handler parameter is a pointer to a function that will be
    called when the receive buffer has been filled. This parameter can be set
    to 0 if the MSS SPI slave is not intended to be the target of SPI write or
    write-read transactions. It can also set to 0 if the MSS SPI slave uses DMA
    to handle data written to it.
 
  Slave performing operation based on master command:
  In this example the SPI slave is configured to receive 10 bytes of data or
  command from the SPI slave and process the data received from the master.

  Slave responding to command example:
  In this example the slave will return data based on a command sent by the
  master. The first part of the transaction is handled using polled mode where
  each byte returned to the master is written as part of the interrupt service
  routine. The second part of the transaction, where the slave returns data
  based on the command value, is sent using a DMA transfer initiated by the
  receive handler.
