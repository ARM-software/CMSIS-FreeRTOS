/*
 * This is a very simple demo that creates two tasks and one queue.  One task
 * (the queue receive task) blocks on the queue to wait for data to arrive,
 * toggling an LED each time '100' is received.  The other task (the queue send
 * task) repeatedly blocks for a fixed period before sending '100' to the queue
 * (causing the first task to toggle the LED).
 *
 * For a much more complete and complex example select either the Debug or
 * Debug_with_optimisation build configurations within the Embedded Workbench
 * IDE.
