/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting (defined in this file) is used to
 * select between the two.  The simply blinky demo is implemented and described
 * in main_blinky.c.  The more comprehensive test and demo application is
 * implemented and described in main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.
 *
 * This project does not provide an example of how to write an RTOS compatible
 * interrupt service routine (other than the tick interrupt itself), so this
 * file contains the function vAnExampleISR_C_Handler() as a dummy example (that
 * is not actually installed) that can be used as a reference.  Also see the
 * file ExampleISR.S, and the documentation page for this demo on the
 * FreeRTOS.org website for full instructions.
 *
 * ENSURE TO READ THE DOCUMENTATION PAGE FOR THIS PORT AND DEMO APPLICATION ON
 * THE http://www.FreeRTOS.org WEB SITE FOR FULL INFORMATION ON USING THIS DEMO
 * APPLICATION, AND ITS ASSOCIATE FreeRTOS ARCHITECTURE PORT!
