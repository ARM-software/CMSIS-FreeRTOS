/*
 * Tests the floating point context save and restore mechanism.
 *
 * Two tasks are created - each of which is allocated a buffer of 
 * portNO_FLOP_REGISTERS_TO_SAVE 32bit variables into which the flop context
 * of the task is saved when the task is switched out, and from which the
 * flop context of the task is restored when the task is switch in.  Prior to 
 * the tasks being created each position in the two buffers is filled with a 
 * unique value - this way the flop context of each task is different.
 *
 * The two test tasks never block so are always in either the Running or
 * Ready state.  They execute at the lowest priority so will get pre-empted
 * regularly, although the yield frequently so will not get much execution
 * time.  The lack of execution time is not a problem as its only the 
 * switching in and out that is being tested.
 *
 * Whenever a task is moved from the Ready to the Running state its flop 
 * context will be loaded from the buffer, but while the task is in the
 * Running state the buffer is not used and can contain any value - in this
 * case and for test purposes the task itself clears the buffer to zero.  
 * The next time the task is moved out of the Running state into the
 * Ready state the flop context will once more get saved to the buffer - 
 * overwriting the zeros.
 *
 * Therefore whenever the task is not in the Running state its buffer contains
 * the most recent values of its floating point registers - the zeroing out
 * of the buffer while the task was executing being used to ensure the values 
 * the buffer contains are not stale.
 *
 * When neither test task is in the Running state the buffers should contain
 * the unique values allocated before the tasks were created.  If so then
 * the floating point context has been maintained.  This check is performed
 * by the 'check' task (defined in main.c) by calling 
 * xAreFlopRegisterTestsStillRunning().
 *
 * The test tasks also increment a value each time they execute.
 * xAreFlopRegisterTestsStillRunning() also checks that this value has changed
 * since it last ran to ensure the test tasks are still getting processing time.
