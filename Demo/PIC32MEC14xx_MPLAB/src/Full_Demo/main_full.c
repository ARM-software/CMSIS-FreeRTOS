/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the comprehensive test and demo version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * full demo.  Generic functions, such as FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware, are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_full() creates all the demo application tasks and software timers, then
 * starts the scheduler.  The WEB documentation provides more details of the
 * standard demo application tasks.  In addition to the standard demo tasks, the
 * following tasks and tests are also defined:
 *
 * "Register test" tasks - These tasks are used in part to test the kernel port.
 * They set each processor register to a known value, then check that the
 * register still contains that value.  Each of the tasks sets the registers
 * to different values, and will get swapping in and out between setting and
 * then subsequently checking the register values.  Discovery of an incorrect
 * value would be indicative of an error in the task switching mechanism.
 *
 * "High Frequency Timer Test" - The high frequency timer is created to test
 * the interrupt nesting method.  The standard demo interrupt nesting test tasks
 * are created with priorities at or below configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY
 * because they use interrupt safe FreeRTOS API functions.  The high frequency
 * time is created with a priority above configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY,
 * so cannot us the same API functions.
 *
 * "Check" timer - The check software timer period is initially set to three
 * seconds.  The callback function associated with the check software timer
 * checks that all the standard demo tasks, and the register check tasks, are
 * not only still executing, but are executing without reporting any errors.  If
 * the check software timer discovers that a task has either stalled, or
 * reported an error, then it changes its own execution period from the initial
 * three seconds, to just 200ms.  The check software timer also toggle LED
 * mainCHECK_LED;  If mainCHECK_LED toggles every 3 seconds, no errors have
 * been detected.  If mainCHECK_LED toggles every 200ms then an error has been
 * detected in at least one task.
