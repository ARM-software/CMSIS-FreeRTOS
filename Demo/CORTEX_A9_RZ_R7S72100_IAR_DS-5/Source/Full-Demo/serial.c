	BASIC INTERRUPT DRIVEN SERIAL PORT DRIVER FOR UART2.

	***Note*** This example uses queues to send each character into an interrupt
	service routine and out of an interrupt service routine individually.  This
	is done to demonstrate queues being used in an interrupt, and to deliberately
	load the system to test the FreeRTOS port.  It is *NOT* meant to be an
	example of an efficient implementation.  An efficient implementation should
	use the DMA, and only use FreeRTOS API functions when enough has been
	received to warrant a task being unblocked to process the data.
