/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, and a more comprehensive demo application that makes use of
 * FreeRTOS_CLI, FreeRTOS+UDP and FreeRTOS+FAT SL.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the simply blinky style version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * basic demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware, are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_blinky() creates one queue, two tasks and one software timer.  It then
 * starts the scheduler.
 *
 * The Queue Send Task:
 * The queue send task is implemented by the prvQueueSendTask() function in
 * this file.  The task sits in a loop that sends a value to the queue every
 * 200 milliseconds.
 *
 * The Queue Receive Task:
 * The queue receive task is implemented by the prvQueueReceiveTask() function
 * in this file.  The task sits in a loop that blocks on the queue to wait for
 * data to arrive (it does not use any CPU time while it is in the Blocked
 * state), toggling an LED each time it receives the value sent by the queue
 * send task.  As the queue send task writes to the queue every 200 milliseconds
 * the LED will toggle every 200 milliseconds.
