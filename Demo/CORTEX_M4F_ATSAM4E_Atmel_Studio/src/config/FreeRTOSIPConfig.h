/* The IP stack executes it its own task (although any application task can make
use of its services through the published sockets API). ipconfigUDP_TASK_PRIORITY
sets the priority of the task that executes the IP stack.  The priority is a
standard FreeRTOS task priority so can take any value from 0 (the lowest
priority) to (configMAX_PRIORITIES - 1) (the highest priority).
configMAX_PRIORITIES is a standard FreeRTOS configuration parameter defined in
FreeRTOSConfig.h, not FreeRTOSIPConfig.h. Consideration needs to be given as to
the priority assigned to the task executing the IP stack relative to the
priority assigned to tasks that use the IP stack.

Note:  If the application is started without the network cable plugged in then
this should be set to the lowest priority - otherwise the Atmel ASF GMAC driver
will poll the GMAC interface waiting for a connection to be established.  The
driver uses a very long timeout and no lower priority tasks will be able to
execute during this time.  This demo starts with the IP task running at the idle
priority - then raises the priority of the IP task in the network event hook
when a connection has been established. */

a network buffer cannot be obtained then the calling task is held in the Blocked

becomes available or the send block time expires.  If the send block time expires
then the send operation is aborted.  The maximum allowable send block time is
capped to the value set by ipconfigMAX_SEND_BLOCK_TIME_TICKS.  Capping the
maximum allowable send block time prevents prevents a deadlock occurring when
all the network buffers are in use and the tasks that process (and subsequently
free) the network buffers are themselves blocked waiting for a network buffer.

stack will revert to using the static IP address even when ipconfigUSE_DHCP is

reason.  The static configuration used is that passed into the stack by the
FreeRTOS_IPInit() function call. */

address associated with the IP address, or the MAC address of the router used to
contact the remote IP address.  When a UDP message is received from a remote IP
address the MAC address and IP address are added to the ARP cache.  When a UDP
message is sent to a remote IP address that does not already appear in the ARP
cache then the UDP message is replaced by a ARP message that solicits the

alternative called FreeRTOS_inet_addr_quick() is provided.  FreeRTOS_inet_addr()
takes an IP in decimal dot format (for example, "192.168.0.1") as its parameter.
FreeRTOS_inet_addr_quick() takes an IP address as four separate numerical octets
(for example, 192, 168, 0, 1) as its parameters.  If

wait for incoming connections on a known port number).  If
