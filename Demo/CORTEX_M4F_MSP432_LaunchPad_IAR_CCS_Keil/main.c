/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * configCREATE_SIMPLE_TICKLESS_DEMO setting (defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h) is
 * used to select between the two.  The simply blinky demo is implemented and
 * described in main_blinky.c.  The more comprehensive test and demo application
 * is implemented and described in main_full.c.
 *
 * The comprehensive demo uses FreeRTOS+CLI to create a simple command line 
 * interface through a UART.
 *
 * The blinky demo uses FreeRTOS's tickless idle mode to reduce power 
 * consumption.  See the notes on the web page below regarding the difference
 * in power saving that can be achieved between using the generic tickless
 * implementation (as used by the blinky demo) and a tickless implementation
 * that is tailored specifically to the MSP432.
 * 
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific.
 *
 * See http://www.FreeRTOS.org/TI_MSP432_Free_RTOS_Demo.html for instructions.
