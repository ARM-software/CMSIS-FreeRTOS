## Generate CMSIS Pack for Release

This GitHub development repository contains all the sources you need to successfully build the pack.

To build the complete pack for installation, the following additional tools are required:
 - **doxygen.exe**    Version: 1.8.6 (Documentation Generator)
 - **mscgen.exe**     Version: 0.20  (Message Sequence Chart Converter)
 - **7z.exe (7-Zip)** Version: 16.04 (File Archiver)
  
Using these tools, you can generate on a Windows PC:
 - **CMSIS-FreeRTOS software pack** using the batch file **gen_pack.bat** (located in ./Utilities). This batch file also
   generates the documentation.
  
 - **CMSIS-FreeRTOS documentation** using the batch file **genDoc.bat** (located in ./Doxygen). 

The file ./DoxyGen/How2Doc.txt describes the rules for creating API documentation.
